I will briefly touch on some technical decisions that the Alien::Base team has made since I took over as the primary maintainer, and the next big steps that Alien needs to make to further capitalize on the progress that we’ve made.</td>

But it doesn't have to be. What if you had a simple mental model for reasoning about consistency? What if you had simple rules of thumb for making the right tradeoffs in your applications?

                You are cordially invited to submit talks for the 2016
                DC-Baltimore Perl Workshop, which will be held on Saturday,
                April 16, 2016, in <a href="/dcbpw2016/venue/">Baltimore, MD</a>!
                </p>
                <p>
                Submit via the <a
                                      href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wk9V7THT_SA5mq2lH_qJEMoR0QSQ53Pch-5bMhRpOQs/viewform">Google
                                      Form</a> (a new experiment this year).
                </p>
                <p>
                As in previous years, by default talks are 25 minutes, which
                we've found is a sweet spot for most topics. We get a great
                variety -- enough to get a dose of newness and not overwhelm.
                We also welcome proposals for more tutorial-style talks of
                around 50 minutes. We'll take the talks and build out a
                two-track schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                Speakers of all levels are welcome! This regional meetup is
                great for getting your first taste of giving a community
                talk, sharing projects or topics that you have experience
                with, or even doing a first run for a talk you'll be
                presenting at a larger conference! All Perl-related topics
                are welcome -- from beginner to advanced, from technical to
                social.
                </p>
                <p>
                No need to submit talks for the Sunday April 17 hackathon --
                we'll have more info on that code and learning festival in
                future updates! And of course -- all are welcome to register
                for the conference -- this year you can register over at <a
